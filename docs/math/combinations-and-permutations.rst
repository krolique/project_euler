Combinations and Permutations
=============================
There are often enough time when you may wander how many possible combinations
(or permutations) can be made when you arrange things from a given set. Without
thinking we may use these two words interchangeably. However their meaning is
quite different depending upon what do you actually mean. The answer comes down
to a simple few questions.

    1. Does the order matter?

    2. Are repetitions allowed?

What's the Difference?
----------------------
Lets look at this noun in the dictionary::


and now lets look at the other noun definition::



The `regard` for order becomes apparent from the definition of `combinations`
and so the distinctions boils down to the order of elements.

if 123 is the same as 321 to you then its combinations you are referring to but
if not, such as a password of 123 is not the same as 321, then its
permutations.


Permutations
------------
Order matters, order matters, order matters (in that order!)




This can be written as a formula in the following fashion::

            n!
        ---------
         (n - r)!

Combinations
------------
We don't care about positions of each choice! We don't care about the position
of each choice! (like totally!)


Also known as `Binomial Coefficient`, and this equation is just like
permutations with the added effect of removing the number of time each
combination could be in order
