has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right
child.

Properties of binary trees
---------------------------

The number of nodes n in a full binary tree, is at least n = 2^h and at most
n = 2^(h+1) - 1, where h is the height of the tree. A tree consisting of only 
a root node has a height of 0.



The number of leaf nodes l in a perfect binary tree, is l = (n + 1) / 2 because
the number of non-leaf (a.k.a. internal) nodes
