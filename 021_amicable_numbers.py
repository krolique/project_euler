    Problem #21 - Amicable numbers
    ------------------------------

    Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than
    n which divide evenly into n).

    If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a â‰  b, then a and b are an amicable pair
    and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

    For example, the proper divisors of 220 are

        1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110;

    therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are

        1, 2, 4, 71 and 142;

    so d(284) = 220.

    Evaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.
