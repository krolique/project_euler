    This function returns True for formal pandigital numbers (defined below) as

    given below.

    A number is said to be pandigital if it contains each of the digits from 0
    to 9 (and whose leading digit must be nonzero). However, "zeroless"
    pandigital quantities contain the digits 1 through 9. Sometimes exclusivity
    is also required so that each digit is restricted to appear exactly once.
    For example, 6729/13458 is a (zeroless, restricted) pandigital fraction and
    1023456789 is the smallest (zerofull) pandigital number.
